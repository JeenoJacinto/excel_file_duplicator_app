This program only works on windows.

Click the exe file to run (application)

This creates the excel template sheets for the JGMC time sheet.
DONT EVER CHANGE ANY FILE NAMES OR PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

Editing excel_file_prime in the template folder is how you can make changes to the spread sheet.

(DO NOT MESS WITH THE TABLE's STRUCTURE IN ANY WAY or where the first row starts.)
(This program is meant to automate changes to formulas, anything below the table, or above the table but not deleting any rows above the table and shifting up.)

All 30 newly modified files (that comply with the changes to the template) can be found in the excel_file_dump folder.
